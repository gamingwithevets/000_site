# Backstory
**000.exe** is a computer virus made by YouTuber [FlyTech Videos](youtube.com/FlyTechVideos) as a [creepypasta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHlvjC6yOtM). The video gained a lot of attention that FlyTech decided to release it publicly.

## The video
The video shows FlyTech using Internet Explorer to go to a website to download the virus. It has a green background and a hyperlink with the text "000" on it.  
Some sources claim that the website "automatically downloads the virus", but this is false; FlyTech clicked on the hyperlink himself.

The site's address is blurred, but FlyTech hovered over the site title, long enough for the full website title and address to be shown. FlyTech forgot to blur this short segment with the address and left it unblurred.

It turns out it's just a local HTML file opened with Internet Explorer (the path is just `C:\Users\FlyTech\Documents\site.html`). This was disappointing, as FlyTech never released this file.

# What I did
Using Snip & Sketch and Microsoft Paint, I was able to get the hex value of the color of the site's background.  
And I used the original video to ultimately recreate the HTML page.

And since the original page downloaded an unzipped version of the virus, I also downloaded the virus and unzipped it.  
I have included the original repo license for 000.exe. Please don't sue me, FlyTech!

# Where is the website?
It's available at [https://gamingwithevets.github.io/000_site](https://gamingwithevets.github.io/000_site)!  
Be careful on there!
